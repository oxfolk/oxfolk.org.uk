This is one of heck of an innovative, jazzy and highly danceable band – you’re going to love them! 

At the centre of the line-up is the nephew and uncle pairing of Owen Woods, an up and coming melodeon player and the acclaimed jazz saxophonist, [Tony Woods](https://tonywoods.org/biography/).   Tony is known not only for his jazz but also cross genre ensembles such as The Avalon Trio, as featured on Radio 3 and Jazz FM.  Owen is known for his solo work (find out about Boxtet, his excellent and fascinating debut album [here](http://melodeonmusic.com/2016/08/11/in-any-weather/)).  For the Jazz Ceilidh Project they are joined by tuba player Paul Tkachenko and percussionist Terry Knight to produce an exciting, rich, funky sound.  You can hear a taste of [The Jazz Ceilidh Project here](https://soundcloud.com/owen-woods/sets/jazz-ceilidh-project)

They are joined by **Mae McAllister**, formerly of Cambridge University Ceilidh Band and also a composer.
