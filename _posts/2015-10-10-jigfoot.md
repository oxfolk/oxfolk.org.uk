[Jigfoot](http://www.jigfoot.com/) is bursting with vitality, playing tunes with swooping melodies and a swing that will keep you dancing all night! The Southampton-based band specialises in playing traditional tunes from Hampshire and the surrounding area.  The line-up features Ben Potton - fiddle, Gill Redmond - cello, Kim Sheil - melodeon and Cath Watkins - fiddle.

This evening's caller is [Mike Courthold](http://www.courthold-family.com/mike/) whose vast repertoire of dances and easy-going manner makes him a favourite with very many dancers.

**Simon and Jo Harmer** have worked with Jigfoot to develop their excellent performances of southern step dancing, and we are lucky to be entertained by them at half-time this evening.
