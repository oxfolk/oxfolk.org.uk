We're so pleased to have Oxfolk favourites [The Geckoes](http://www.geckoes.co.uk/) back.  The band emerged over 25 years ago from sessions in Eynsham and quickly became one bands that shaped the English ceilidh scene with an exuberant, fresh and utterly danceable approach to their tunes.  They feature Andy Turner - anglo-concertina, Caroline Butler - fiddle, Andy Cheyne - bass guitar, acoustic guitar, mandolin, fiddle, Tom Miller - electric guitar, keyboards and most recently joined Matt Quinn - melodeon.  Their resident caller Alan Simpson has a dance for every occasion and this is certainly going to be one!

We're joined by another Oxfordshire favourite - [Icknield Way Morris Men](http://www.icknieldwaymorrismen.org.uk/) from Wantage.  They will perform during the half-time break.
