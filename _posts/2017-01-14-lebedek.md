[Lebedek](http://www.lebedek.com/) was a real hit when the band last played Oxfolk. The members of the band have Ukrainian, Macedonian, Polish, Jewish and English roots, plus experience in everything from musical theatre to playing for morris. They draw on this diverse heritage to create their unique blend of music. The line- up features Katrina Warcaba on piano accordion, Lydia Ristova Whittaker and Shelley van Loen on violins and Simon Loake on bazouki and calling.  'Lebedek' is a Yiddish word meaning 'lively and vivacious'... and we know youâ€™ll love them.
