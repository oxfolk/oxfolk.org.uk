[The Hosepipe Band](http://www.hosepipeband.co.uk/) have more than a touch of Suffolk sophistication and French influences.  They have a very tuneful, quirky and cheerfully raucous approach to music; so expect bagpipes, hurdy gurdy, melodeon and bells to feature in their quite splendid music.  The line-up features: Simon Haines on melodeons, concertina, hurdy gurdy; Geoff Coombs on mandola; Val Woollard on flute, recorder, bagpipes, saxophone, bells, hammered dulcimer and Matt Haines on bass guitar.

We're pleased to welcome Cambridgeshire-based caller, __Adam Hughes__, to Oxfolk.  He's often seen at Sidmouth, Unicorn Ceilidhs and The Round Ceilidhs in Cambridge.  His repertoire encompasses classic English dances, contra and Playford.  Rest assured he'll have us all dancing in no time at all!
