We are delighted to welcome [Moirai](http://www.moiraitrio.co.uk/): featuring what The Living Tradition magazine calls the “three auspicious talents” of Jo Freya (Blowzabella, Token Women, Fraser Sisters), Sarah Matthews (Cupola, Cupola:Ward) and Melanie Biggs (Boxtet).

This trio of superb dance musicians play compelling, beautiful and irresistible music and will give you a night of dancing you will never forget. 

This is a Euroceilidh, so expect some continental European dances as well some ceilidh classics. All the dances will be carefully explained and called by Jo and special guest caller **Daisy Black**. Daisy is a Sheffield based caller, co-founder of Playford in the Pub (what a brilliant idea!) and expert on many literary and medieval things.

Half-time entertainment comes from the glorious [Mabel Gubbins](http://www.mabelgubbins.co.uk/), Oxfordshire’s premier rapper team. If you’ve never seen rapper sword dancing before, it’s far too complicated to explain here, so come and see for yourself.
