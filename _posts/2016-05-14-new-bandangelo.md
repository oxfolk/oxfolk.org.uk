__New BandAnglo__ is the essence of classic English dance music.  Featuring members of bands such as The Albion Band, The Geckoes, Random and The Old Fasioned, the new band play straight up, no-nonsence, infectiously dancy music. Keith Kendrick, anglo concertina, leads the band and he is joined by Sylvia Needham on banjolele, Pete Bullock on baritone sax, Pierce Butler on percussion, Keith Holloway on melodeons and Tom Miller on keyboards.

__Will Hall__, probably Oxfordshire's most in-demand caller, joins the band with his unique collection of dances.  

__Rose Hips__, Wantage's colourful and exuberant belly dance troupe, brings Oxfolk's season to a close, with a hint of summer ahead of us.
