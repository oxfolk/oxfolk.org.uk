[The Ironmasters](http://www.theironmasters.co.uk/) are old favourites under a new name.  Formerly known as All Blacked Up, the recent name change harks back to the band’s origins with the Ironmen and Severn Gilders, the morris team from Ironbridge in Shropshire.  

In over 25 years, the band has established itself at the forefront of loud and rumbustious folk rock ceilidhs.  The line-up features Alistair Gillies on saxes, Edwin Beasant (also Pilgrim’s Way) on melodeons, Baz Parkes on melodeons, harmonica and calling, Steev Hall on guitar (also This Way Up), Ray Archer on bass and Nick Beck on drums.

Baz, known for his excellent choice of dances and his wry West Midlands wit, will be explaining all the dances and making sure that we all have a terrific night.
