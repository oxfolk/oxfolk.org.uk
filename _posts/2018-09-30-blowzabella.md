The legendary [Blowzabella](http://blowzabella.co.uk/) returns to Oxford, to play the last UK date in the band's 2018 tour, celebrating their 40th anniversary.

Blowzabella is a genuinely unique band, making an inimitable, driving, drone-based sound played with a fabulous sense of melody, rhythmic expertise and sheer feeling. With a band stuffed full of wonderful composers, their tunes have become “standards” in the modern British/European folk repertoire and are played by people all over the world. Much loved and respected, there is no one else quite like them.

Blowzabella are Andy Cutting – diatonic button accordion; Jo Freya – vocals, saxophone, clarinet; Paul James – bagpipes, saxophones; Gregory Jolivet – hurdy-gurdy; David Shepherd – violin; Barn Stradling – bass guitar; Jon Swayne – bagpipes, saxophone.

After a their fantastic visit to Oxford in 2016, it's great to have them back again. Whilst the band celebrates its 40th anniversary, we're also marking the early days of Oxfolk Ceilidhs in the mid 80s, when Blowzabella played.

Doors open at 4pm, dancing starts at 4.30 and finishes at 7.
Tickets are £15 (£5 for 25 years and under) and are available [here](https://fao.yapsody.com/event/index/178211/bal-with-blowzabella)

_This event is promoted by Blowzabella in association with Oxfolk and Folk Weekend Oxford_
