### Dance spot from **Old Speckled Hen North West Morris**

**Cat Kelly and Pete Ord** are two-thirds of Triptych, who went down a storm at Oxfolk last
year. These experienced dance-musicians play a range of traditional and more modern tunes
on fiddle and guitar. You will also recognise Pete from his playing with The Ship Band and
Cat as a caller, Festival Director of Folk Weekend Oxford and from her days of organising
Oxfolk.

They are joined by caller **Sheena Masson**, a caller with a fantastic collection of dances
and a lovely on-stage manner. With this trio of ceilidh-expertise, we are in for a smashing
night.

[Old Speckled Hen](http://oldspeckledhen.org/), Abingdonâ€™s North West morris side, will
make their impression at half-time. Their precision clog morris is always a joy to watch.
