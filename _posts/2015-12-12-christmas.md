Oxfolk's Christmas party is with [Threepenny Bit](http://threepennybit.com/). This dynamic eight-piece band combines a group of die-hard folkies with some of the finest young jazz and classical musicians of the south. They play bold arrangements of traditional and original tunes with infectious stage energy.  They have quickly become favourites on the festival circuits and were a hit at Folk Weekend Oxford this year, packing out the Saturday night ceilidh.  We can't wait to dance to them again.  

The line-up boasts: Jason Beaumont on flute, bass guitar; Ruth Burrows on alto saxophone; Helen Gentile on clarinet; Hannah Gray on flute, low D whistle, Chris Nichols on violin, viola; Josh Robson-Hemmings on guitar; Steven Troughton on accordion, and Ross Gordon on percussion.

Phill Moxley is the big man with the ceilidh moves.  He appeared last season with Barry Goodman and we are really looking forward to having him back.
