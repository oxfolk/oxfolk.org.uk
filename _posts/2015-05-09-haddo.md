### Song spot from Rising Voices

Also back for a return visit is [Haddo](http://www.haddoentertainments.co.uk/ceilidh-
band.html), another duo and they last played at Oxfolk in January 2012. The BBC Folk
Awards nominated musician Will Pound, is best known his harmonica playing, but with Haddo
he plays melodeon, alongside Nicky Grant, viola and fiddle player with a folk and baroque
background. The duo produces a rich and exciting sound, with driving tunes and unexpected
harmonic twists.

As well for her exquisite musicianship, **Jo Freya** is known for her calling with
**Blowzabella** and **Token Women**. Tonight Jo introduces **Daisy Black**, founder of
Sheffield’s Playford in the Pub. Daisy is the last of this season’s callers from Cat’s Calling
Academy.

To round off this season, Risinghurst’s own community choir, **Rising Voices**, will entertain
us with rousing choruses and touching harmonies.
