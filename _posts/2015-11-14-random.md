__Random__ is 15 this year!  This is classic folk rock ceilidh music at its best and we're lucky enough to host the last ceilidh of their anniversary year.  The Random men in black are Saul Rose on melodeon, Paul Nye on melodeon and harmonica, Keith Holloway on bass guitar, Ian Woledge on rhythm guitar, Roger Smith on drums and Maclaine Colston on hammered dulcimer.  Here's to the next 15!

We are delighted to have caller __Gordon Potts__ with us to call all the right dances in just the right way.
