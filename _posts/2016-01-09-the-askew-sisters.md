[The Askew Sisters](http://www.askewsisters.co.uk/index.htm) bring us uplifting dance tunes, played with driving energy and the unity of two people who have played together all their lives.  This is an rare opportunity to dance to Hazel and Emily's fiddle and melodeon tunes.  Their latest album, In the Air or the Earth, was released to widespread critical acclaim, including the Spiral Earth Award for Best Traditional Album 2015.

__Ben Moss__ is our caller this evening.  You may recognise him as an ace morris dancer (Hammersmith, Great Western), or as one half of a duo with Laurel Swift, or as that man that did the London Marathon in morris kit.  He's also very good indeed at choosing and teaching dances.

Interval entertainment come from the __Islip Eurodancers__, who bring some lovely Scandinavian melodies to listen to.
