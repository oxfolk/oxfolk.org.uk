      <p>
        A ceilidh is an evening of high-energy dancing, similar to barn dancing
        or country dancing. The music is always live and loud and dancing is
        often fast and furious. Oxfolk plays host to many of the best ceilidh
        bands on the English folk scene and there will always be an excellent
        caller to guide you through the dances.

        When weâ€™re at Kennington Village Centre, there's a bar with reasonably
        priced beer, cider, wine and soft drinks.
