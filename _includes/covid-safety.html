    <h2><i class="covid-19"></i> Covid-19 Safety Guidance</h2>
    <p>
      We know that we need to keep everyone who wants to come to our dances as
      safe as possible. Our safety guidance for everyone attending is this:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you have Covid symptoms please don’t come. If you have bought a
        ticket, we will refund you, no questions asked.
      </li>
      <li>
        All of Oxfolk’s volunteers will have done lateral flow tests before the
        ceilidh to keep you safe, and we ask you to do the same. Ideally, do
        your test in the hour before you leave for the ceilidh, and certainly
        not more than 48 hours beforehand. Home-test kits are free, and
        available

        (also available to collect from many pharmacies).
      </li>
      <li>We are restricting the number of tickets we sell.</li>
      <li>The hall will be ventilated.</li>
      <li>Sanitizer and hand washing facilities will be available.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Whilst government guidance still permits ceilidhs, we are currently
      planning to run these dances. If the law requires us to use the

        >Covid Pass</a
      >
      we will do so. However, this is a fast changing situation, and if we need
      to postpone we will do so. We plan to review safety in the week before
      each event, and will let you know in good time if we postpone. Keep an eye
      on our social media for updates:
