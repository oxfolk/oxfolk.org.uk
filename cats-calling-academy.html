            <strong>Cat's Calling Academy</strong>, founded by caller Cat Kelly, offers a unique opportunity for callers to develop and showcase their talents, as well as reflect on and hone their calling skills in a supportive environment, and receive input and feedback from some of the country's top ceilidh callers and musicians.  We held our forth Callers' Workshop in February 2014 and from it some of the best callers who attended were chosen to appear this season.  They are
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Phill Moxley</strong>, caller with <a href="http://www.threepennybit.net/" target="_blank">Threepenny Bit</a> and a founder member of University of <a href="http://folksocsoton.com/" target="_blank">Southampton Folk Society</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Daisy Black</strong>, key player in the Sheffield and Cambridge dance-scenes, and caller and organiser for Sheffield's <strong>Playford in the Pub</strong> 
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="http://www.callersarah.co.uk/" target="_blank">Sarah Clough</a>, from Stoke-on-Trent and regular caller with <strong>The Hacklers</strong> and <strong>The Old School Band</strong>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            They are introduced by their mentors <strong>Jo Freya</strong>, <strong>Fee Lock</strong>, <strong>Barry Goodman</strong> and <strong>Andrew Swaine</strong>.  We are bringing some excellent callers to a wider audience and we hope that you will enjoy the chance to dance to them.
        </p>
            This season we are also very pleased to welcome back <a href="http://www.lisaheywood.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lisa Heywood</a>, who appeared in January 2011, in the first season of <strong>Cat's Calling Academy</strong>.  She has since gone on to call at many festivals including Sidmouth FolkWeek, Warwick Folk Festival and Folk Weekend Oxford as well as regularly performing at Sheffield University Ceilidh Society.

            We plan to run more callers workshops in the future, so please get in touch if you would like to be added to our <a href="info@oxfolk.org.uk" target="_blank">mailing list</a>.  Here is what some participants have said about past workshops:
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>
            "Excellent workshop, lots of information put across in a friendly, non-patronising and often amusing way."
        </li>
        <li>
            "Useful to get targeted feedback in a friendly and supportive environment."
        </li>
        <li>
            "As an absolute beginner I am finding the course enormously helpful and informative."
        </li>
        <li>
            "Nice to work with such talented musicians and callers"
        </li>
        <li>
            "Being able to ask questions about calling situations I might not have experienced yet was useful"
        </li>

        <li>
            "Hearing these people have different opinions was reassuring... there’s no one perfect way to call.... it’s ok to have "your" way as long as it works!"
        </li>
